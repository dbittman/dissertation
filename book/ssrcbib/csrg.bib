% This bibliography contains a lot of papers!  Please feel free to
% add more and then commit your changes. 
%
% There are a few rules about adding new citations:
% * All citations should include first names and page numbers.
% * The key for a citation should be of the form:
%   lastname:confxx
%   where "lastname" is the last name of the first author,
%   "conf" is the abbreviation of the conference or journal in which
%   the paper appeared, and "xx" is the two-digit year of publication.
%   If a key would not be unique, add a letter to the end of the
%   key to make it unique.  For example, you might have:
%   long:ipccc01
%   long:ipccc01a
%   if there were two papers with "Long" as the first author in IPCCC 2001.
% * Use strings corresponding to conference names.  The string should be
%   of the form confxx, where "conf" is the standard conference abbreviation
%   and xx is the year.  DO NOT USE sequence numbers here (ie, don't use
%   osdi4 for the OSDI that occurred in 2000---we never remember which
%   OSDI is which, but we typically know the year).  For each string you
%   use, create an entry in the top of the bibliography for the string.
%   This entry can include year-specific info (such as "10th Annual
%   Conference on Foo").  You need only create a string if you expect
%   more than one or two papers from the conference.
% * Please keep the bibliography alphabetized by key.
%   Use the emacs command "bibtex-sort-buffer" to do this.
% * "page" fields with ranges are formatted with the "--" dash between
%   the numbers for consistency although bibtex will rewrite them anyway.

  abstract = {The promise has been made: ``Digital information is
                  forever. It doesn't deteriorate and requires little
                  in the way of material media.'' So said one of the
                  chieftains of the emerging digital age,
                  computer-chip maker Andy Grove, the head of the
                  Intel Corporation. Another chieftain, Librarian of
                  Congress James H. Billington, has set about
                  digitizing the world?s largest library so that its
                  contents can become accessible by anyone, from
                  anywhere, forever. But a shadow has fallen. ``It is
                  only slightly facetious,'' wrote RAND researcher
                  Jeff Rothenberg in Scientific American, ``to say
                  that digital information lasts forever---or five
                  years, whichever comes first.''},

  abstract = {
Managing large objects with high data-rate requirements is difficult for
current computing systems.  We describe an Input/Output architecture,
called Swift, that addresses the problem of storing and retrieving very
large data objects from slow secondary storage at very high data-rates.
Applications that require this capability are poorly supported in current
systems, even though they are made possible by high-speed networks.
These range from storage and visualization of scientific computations to
recodring and play-back of color video in real-time.  Swift addresses
the problem of providing the data rates required by digital video by
exploiting the available interconnection capacity and by using several
slower storage devices in parallel.

We have done two studies to validate the Swift architecture: a simulation
study and an Ethernet-based proof-of-concept implementation.  Both studies
indicate that the aggregation principle proposed in Swift can yield very
high data-rates.  We present a brief summary of these studies.

  title="AES proposal: Rijindael",
  author="Daemen, Joan and Rijmen, Vincent",
  year="1998",
  publisher="NIST",
abstract={

In this document we describe the cipher Rijndael. First we present the mathematical basis necessary for understanding the specifications followed by the design rationale and the description itself. Subsequently, the implementation aspects of the cipher and its inverse are treated. This is followed by the motivations of all design choices and the treatment of the resistance against known types of attacks. We give our security claims and goals, the advantages and limitations of the cipher, ways how it can be extended and how it can be used for functionality other than block encryption/decryption. We conclude with the acknowledgements, the references and the list of annexes.
Patent Statement: Rijndael or any of its implementations is not and will not be subject to patents.}

              correct analysis of many fault-tolerance and

              estimated host system reliability by querying a large
              number of hosts to find how long they had been
              functioning, estimating the mean time-to-failure
              (MTTF) and availability from those measures, and in
              turn deriving an estimate of the mean time-to-repair
              (MTTR). However, this approach had a bias towards
              more reliable hosts that could result in overestimating
              MTTR and underestimating availability. To address this
              bias we have conducted a second experiment, using a
              fault-tolerant replicated monitoring tool. This tool
              directly measures TTF, TTR, and availability by polling
              many sites frequently from several locations. We find
              that these more accurate results generally confirm and
              improve our earlier estimates. We also find that failure
              and repair are unlikely to follow Poisson processes.}

  abstract = {
We present an I/O architecture, called Swift, that addresses the problem
of data-rate mismatches between the requirements of an application,
the maximum data-rate of the storage devices, and the data-rate of the
interconnection medium.  The goal of Swift is to support integrated
continuous multimedia in general purpose distributed systems.

In installations with a high-speed interconnection medium, Swift will
provide high data-rate transfers by using multiple slower storage
devices in parallel.  The data-rates obtained with this approach scale
well when using multiple storage devices and multiple interconnections.
Swift has the flexibility to use any appropriate storage technology,
including disk arrays.  The ability to adapt to technological advances
will allow Swift to provide for ever increasing I/O demands.  To address
the problem of partial failures, Swift stores data redundantly.

Using the UNIX operating system, we have constructed a simplified
prototype of the Swift architecture.  Using a single Ethernet-based
local-area network and three servers, the prototype provides data-rates
that are almost three times as fast as access to the local SCSI disk in
the case of writes.  When compared with NFS, the Swift prototype provides
double the data-rate for reads and eight times the data-rate for writes.
The data-rate of our prototype scales almost linearly in the number of
servers and the number of network segments.  Its performance is shown
to be limited by the speed of the Ethernet-based local-area network.

We also constructed a simulation model to show how the Swift architecture
can exploit storage, communication, and processor advances, and to
locate the components that will limit I/O performance.  In a simulated
gigabit/second token ring local-area network the data-rates are seen to
scale proportionally to the size of the transfer unit and to the number
of storage agents.

  Geared to data-parallel model. Proc nodes (PNs) contact the timesharing
  daemon (TD) on the control processor (CP), who gets block lists from the file
  system, which runs on one of the CPs. The TD then arranges with the disk
  storage nodes (DSNs) to do the transfer directly with the PNs. Each DSN has
  8~MB of buffer space, 8 disk drives, 4 SCSI busses, and a SPARC as
  controller. Partition managers mount non-local sfs via NFS. Performance
  results good. Up to 185~MB/s on 118 (2~MB/s) disks.}

  abstract = {Commercial publishing interests are presenting the future of the book
	in the digital world through the promotion of e-book reading appliances
	and software. Implicit in this is a very complex and problematic
	agenda that re-establishes the book as a digital cultural artifact
	within a context of intellectual property rights management enforced
	by hardware and software systems. With the convergence of different
	types of content into a common digital bit-stream, developments in
	industries such as music are establishing precedents that may define
	our view of digital books. At the same time we find scholars exploring
	the ways in which the digital medium can enhance the traditional
	communication functions of the printed work, moving far beyond literal
	translations of the pages of printed books into the digital world.
	This paper examines competing visions for the future of the book
	in the digital environment, with particular attention to questions
	about the social implications of controls over intellectual property,
	such as continuity of cultural memory.},

  abstract = {
    Most applications manipulate persistent data, yet traditional systems decouple data
    manipulation from persistence in a two-level storage model. Programming languages
    and system software manipulate data in one set of formats in volatile main memory
    (DRAM) using a load/store interface, while storage systems maintain persistence
    in another set of formats in non-volatile memories, such as Flash and hard disk
    drives in traditional systems, using a file system interface. Unfortunately, such
    an approach suffers from the system performance and energy overheads of locating data,
    moving data, and translating data between the different formats of these two levels
    of storage that are accessed via two vastly different interfaces.

    Yet today, new non-volatile memory (NVM) technologies show the promise of
    storage capacity and endurance similar to or better than Flash at latencies
    comparable to DRAM, making them prime candidates for providing applications
    a persistent single-level store with a single load/store interface to access
    all system data. Our key insight is that in future systems equipped with NVM,
    the energy consumed executing operating system and file system code to access
    persistent data in traditional systems becomes an increasingly large contributor
    to total energy. The goal of this work is to explore the design of a Persistent
    Memory Manager that coordinates the management of memory and storage under a
    single hardware unit in a single address space. Our initial simulation-based
    exploration shows that such a system with a persistent memory can improve
    energy efficiency and performance by eliminating the instructions and data
    movement traditionally used to perform I/O operations.

                  file reference data in a distributed UNIX workstation
                  environment. The design of DFSTrace is unique in that
                  it pays particular attention to efficiency,
                  extensibility, and the logistics of long-term trace
                  data collection in a distributed environment. The
                  components of DFSTrace are a set of kernel hooks, a
                  kernel buffer mechanism, a data extraction agent, a set
                  of collection servers, and post-processing tools. Our
                  experience with DFSTrace has been highly positive.
                  Tracing has been virtually unnoticeable, degrading
                  performance 3-7\%, depending on the level of detail of
                  tracing. We have collected file reference traces from
                  approximately 30 workstations continuously for over two
                  years. We have implemented a post-processing library to
                  provide a convenient programmer interface to the
                  traces, and have created an on-line database of results
                  from a suite of analysis programs to aid trace
                  selection. Our data has been used for a wide variety of
                  purposes, including file system studies, performance
                  measurement and tuning, and debugging. Extensions of
                  DFSTrace have enabled its use in applications such as
                  field reliability testing and determining disk
                  geometry. This paper presents the design,
                  implementation, and evaluation of DFSTrace and
                  associated tools, and describes how they have been
                  used.},

	from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation to develop the first digital
	object repository management system based on the Flexible Extensible
	Digital Object and Repository Architecture (Fedora) [1]. The Digital
	Library Research Group at Cornell University originally developed
	Fedora under a National Science Foundation Grant [1-3]. Fedora is
	one of a number of repository architectures that have been proposed
	over recent years for use in digital libraries. Related architectures
	have included those described in Kahn and Wilensky [4], Arms, et.al.
	[5], Mnch [6], and Nelson and Maly [7]. The Digital Library Research
	and Development Department at the University of Virginia Library
	reinterpreted the architecture and built a prototype that demonstrated
	the feasibility of the architecture with their large and diverse
	digital collections [8]. Together, the two groups make up the development
	team for the project.},

  abstract = { Key-value (KV) stores have become a backbone of large- scale applications
                  in today's data centers. The data set of the store on a single server
                  can grow to billions of KV items or many terabytes, while individual
                  data items are often small (with their values as small as a couple of
                  bytes). It is a daunting task to efficiently organize such an
                  ultra-large KV store to support fast access. Current KV storage systems
                  have one or more of the following inadequacies: (1) very high data write
                  amplifications, (2) large index set, and (3) dramatic degradation of
                  read performance with overspill index out of memory.  To address the
                  issue, we propose LSM-trie, a KV storage system that substantially
                  reduces metadata for locating KV items, reduces write amplification by
                  an order of magnitude, and needs only two disk accesses with each KV
                  read even when only less than 10\% of metadata (Bloom filters) can be
                  held in memory. To this end, LSM-trie constructs a trie, or a prefix
                  tree, that stores data in a hierarchical structure and keeps
                  re-organizing them using a compaction method much more efficient than
                  that adopted for LSM-tree. Our experiments show that LSM-trie can
                  improve write and read throughput of LevelDB, a state-of-the-art KV
                  system, by up to 20 times and up to 10 times, respectively.  },

    Microelectronics researchers have been investigating spin for at
    least 20 years. Indeed, their discoveries revolutionized hard-disk
    drives, which since 1998 have used a spin-based phenomenon to cram
    more bits than ever on to their disks. Within three years,
    Motorola Inc. and IBM Corp. are expected to take the next step,
    introducing the first commercial semiconductor chips to exploit
    spin-a new form of random access memory called M (for magnetic)
    RAM. In this paper, the author describes how the mystical property
    of electron spin is revolutionizing the memory business. If it can
    do the same with logic, electronics will become "spintronics".
