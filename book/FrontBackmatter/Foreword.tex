\chapter*{Foreword}


\squo{BASHIR: Out of all the stories you told me---which ones were true, and which ones weren't?\\
    GARAK: My dear doctor! They're \emph{all} true.\\
    BASHIR: Even the lies?\\
    GARAK: \emph{Especially} the lies.
}{Star Trek: Deep Space Nine}

\squo{All this happened, more or less.}{\emph{Slaughterhouse-Five}, Kurt Vonnegut}

\squo{Audiences know what to expect, and that is all that they are prepared to believe in.}
{\emph{Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead}, Tom Stoppard}

%\squo{You donâ€™t learn about the important things in life from fabricated stories.}{Disco Elysium}

\paragraph{The Honest Narrative}todo


One might well question the logic behind prefacing this disseratation with a refutation of its presented narrative.
However, I think it's important to consider what effect a work may have upon a reader. In particular, if even one
student reads these chapters and comes away with a belief that the scientific process (and, more specifically, the Ph.D.
process) is linear and \emph{not} an experience of one feeling their way through a dark labyrinth, then I will have been
negligent in my duty to help future students and avoid harming them.
