Acknowledgments

None of this work could have been completed without tremendous help, guidance, support, and love. I'd like to say a few
words about all the people who came together to realize this thesis.

My partner, Emily, has been my biggest supporter throughout my studies, and has stood by me through good times and bad
during my PhD. She has given me feedback, helped me formulate and make sense of my thoughts and myself, and, with great
patience and love, has helped me along the way through the marathon that is graduate school.

Next, my advisors, Peter Alvaro and Ethan Miller, provided me the guidance and training I needed to progress through the
program. Ethan, with his concrete and meticulous approach to systems engineering, taught me to analyze, understand, and
question assumptions. Peter taught me to examine the bigger pictures and to put my head in the sky with my feet on the
ground. Both of these wonderful people complemented each other and gave me an incredible graduate school experience. The
raw creativity of both of them I can only hope to emulate.

My journey through graduate school was sparked by a chance meeting with (my, at the time, future undergraduate advisor)
Darrell Long. He recognized a drive and talent for systems work in me and took me in. Darrell is an incredibly kind and
sharp mentor, one who has shaped and influenced my love for all sorts of topics, not just computer science.
The next few years I learned more
from being around a graduate lab than any of my classes as I studied with the help of DJ Capelis, one of Darrell's
students at the time. DJ was a huge inspiration to me, and really shaped .....

Of course, it's an honor to have Pankaj Mehra on my thesis committee as well. Pankaj has been well known in the lab and
a continuous guiding presence for all graduate students. He has a reputation for asking \emph{just the right question}
to get someone unstuck or to challenge them in a new way. Pankaj has been instrumental in the construction of this work
and thesis, offering guidance and ``big picture'' industrial viewpoints that have been extremely vital for the
argumentation herein.

Let us not forget the unending support from my lab mates, in no particular order, Dev Purandare, Peter Wilcox, Michael Usher,
Achilles Benetopoulos, Esteban Ramos, Matt Bryson, Staunton Sample, Yan Li, Lincoln Thurlow, Oceane Bel, Ken Chang,
Sinjoni Mukhopadhyay, Jim Hughes, James Byron, and Yuanjiang Ni, among others. My work would not have come together if not for whiteboarding
sessions, feedback, and discussions with these fine folks.

I'd additionally like to thank Robert Soul√©, Avi Silberschatz, Shel Finkelstein, Andrew Quinn, Ike Nassi, Heiner Litz,
Pat Heland, Bruce Lindsay, and Ahmed Amer for their feedback and discussions. Having the ear of these brilliant people,
but more importantly listening to their insights, has been invaluable.

Finally, all of my friends and family who stuck with me and supported me over the years. You are all amazing, and I love each and
every one of you.
